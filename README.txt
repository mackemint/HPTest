This is my attempt at creating a MIDI controller for Android compatible
for Ableton Live. I want to create a suface similar to the APC40 with 
faders and knobs as well as pads for launching clips and recording.
To make it a little bit more interesting, I want to make the surface velocity
sensitive via the accelerometer and add pitch bend and aftertouch
via TouchEvents.
The controller will be all standard MIDI and will be able to control
any synthesizer or DAW.
